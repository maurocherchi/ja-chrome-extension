|            _The options page_             |

Now you are ready to use the extension üöÄ.

### Job Offer Analysis

The first thing you can do is analyze a job posting page.  
Open the page with your browser, **right-click** on the page, hover over the **Job Analysis** menu item, and then select one of the following options:

1. üßê Analyze job
2. üíæ Analyze and save job

|   ![context-menu-items.png](img/context-menu-items.png)   |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
| _Right click on the page to see the Job Analysis actions_ |

**Analyze job** will perform the analysis for the current job posting page and display the results table.

|  ![analysis-result-1.png](img/analysis-result-1.png)  |

|  ![analysis-result-2.png](img/analysis-result-2.png)  |
|               _Analysis result example_               |

You can choose to save the results in the current project 
(called "default" if you haven't configured it yet; more details on this later). 

**Analyze and save job** will perform the same operation and automatically save the result.

### The Main Panel

The main panel is the most important part of the extension.  
From here, you can manage all aspects of the plugin (except for the API key).

To open the main control panel, click on the plugin icon. A new panel should open on the right side of your screen.

From this panel, you can:

* **Configure the "Current Project"**: It acts as a folder for your data, and you can create multiple projects.
* **Manage the "Link Grabber"**: This feature grabs job posting links from the page while you navigate. It is available only on certain websites, but the list of supported websites is growing.
* **Manage the "Link Scraper"**: It opens the grabbed links in a new tab and extracts the job posting info for the next step: the analysis.
* **Manage the "Job Analyzer"**: This processes the job posting information collected in the previous step.
* **Download the Analysis Results**: By clicking the Download CSV button, you can export a CSV containing all the job posting analysis results. You can then import the file into your preferred CSV reader (Google Sheets, Excel, Open Office, etc.).
