# Why Job Analysis Chrome Extension

This Chrome Extension is meant to:

* üìä Help you analyze the job market
* üç∞ Simplify the job searching process

You could find out, for example, that:

* üåç Berlin offers more full-remote jobs than Munich
* üìà 24% of job offers on Upwork are for website and CMS developers
* üíº 4.5% of job offers on LinkedIn come from the finance & insurance sector
* ... and much more

When you have this information, you can focus your energies on the right platform!\
Maybe on Stepstone there are more job offers for your desired role?

Once you know better the market, you can refine your search filters üîç and tailor your CV üìù to target your ideal clients.\
üéØ Berliner startup in the finance sector?\
üïí SMB part-time DevOps engineer?\
üè¢ SAP consultant for corporates in the manufacturing field?\
You name it!

Once you have chosen your target client, refined your CV, found the best job platforms, 
and adjusted your filters, this extension will help you track down and identify the best offers for you. *

\* üöß This feature is under construction.

|            _The options page_             |

Now you are ready to use the extension üöÄ.

### Job Offer Analysis

The first thing you can do is analyze a job posting page.  
1. Open the page with your browser (* see note below)
2. **Right-click** on the page 
3. Hover over the **Job Analysis** menu item
4. And then select one of the following options:
   * üßê Analyze job 
   * üíæ Analyze and save job

\* Note: Fully open a job posting page, do not run the analysis on pages that contain multiple job previews e.g. linkedin.com/jobs/collections/#####. 
The right page in this case would be linkedin.com/jobs/view/#####.

|   ![context-menu-items.png](img/context-menu-items.png)   |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
| _Right click on the page to see the Job Analysis actions_ |

**Analyze job** will perform the analysis for the current job posting page and display the results table.

|  ![analysis-result-1.png](img/analysis-result-1.png)  |

|  ![analysis-result-2.png](img/analysis-result-2.png)  |
|               _Analysis result example_               |

You can choose to save the results in the current project 
(called "default" if you haven't configured it yet; more details on this later). 

**Analyze and save job** will perform the same operation and automatically save the result.

### The Main Panel

The main panel is the most important part of the extension.  
From here, you can manage all aspects of the plugin (except for the API key).

To open the main control panel, click on the plugin icon. A new panel should open on the right side of your screen.

| ![open-panel.png](img/open-panel.png) |
|:-------------------------------------:|
|     _The main panel once opened_      |

From this panel, you can:

* **Configure the "Current Project"**: It acts as a folder for your data, and you can create multiple projects.
* **Manage the "Link Grabber"**: This feature grabs job posting links from the page while you navigate. It is available only on certain websites, but the list of supported websites is growing.
* **Manage the "Link Scraper"**: It opens the grabbed links in a new tab and extracts the job posting info for the next step: the analysis.
* **Manage the "Job Analyzer"**: This processes the job posting information collected in the previous step.
* **Download the Analysis Results**: By clicking the Download CSV button, you can export a CSV containing all the job posting analysis results. You can then import the file into your preferred CSV reader (Google Sheets, Excel, Open Office, etc.).
